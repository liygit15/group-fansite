                Rei Hino’s role as a shrine maiden comes directly from creator Naoko Takeuchi’s real life.
                While in college, Takeuchi worked as a miko at the Shiba Daijingu Shrine, helping with weddings and ceremonies. 
                She used those experiences to shape Rei’s calm, dedicated, and spiritual personality.
